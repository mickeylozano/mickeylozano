I'm Michelle and I love technology, integrations, and systems management, but mostly, I love being a key role in helping companies transform from the inside out.

In the spring of 2020, I established a freelance business as a high-level DBM (*Digital Business Manager*) for over a dozen women-owned and minority-owned small businesses. I developed my own best practices in remote work and time management, consistently meeting client needs for up to 5 CEOs at a time.
My services have included:

- Tech and Integration Support
- Systems Strategy & Management
- Data Analytics
- Strategic Marketing Support

I gained a deep understanding of a wide variety of industries from a range of clientele. Some of my clients' areas of business include:

- *Forbes*-Featured Social Media Influencers
- Professional Podcasters
- Fisheries Science & Academia
- Brand Strategy & Copywriting
- Award-Winning Interior Design
- Brick-and-Mortar Local Small Businesses in Austin TX

As a solopreneur, I learned to utilize and transform data into business assets and strategic decisions, creating intentional action toward the CEO's mission and vision.
